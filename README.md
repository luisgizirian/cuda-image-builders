# Stack images for devcontainer using a Jetson Orin Nano with Docker to develop/test/run programs, sharing its GPU.

(working title)

Goals
* Uncluttered digital environment. Work on different projects with different programming stacks and versions always accessing the GPU while keeping a clean host.
* Uncluttered physical environment (not 100% achieved yet - failing for X11 - graphical applications). Use your main computer to develop and avoid multiple keyboards and mice forcing you to twist yourself all day long.

## Our tools

Ideal scenario:

## TODO
* Figure out how to use one or other `devcontainer.json` in different base images when working on the "Nano" or other computer. Or other way to choose at dev time.
